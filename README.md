# Personal Blog Website
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)

## Introduction

Utilize my HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations.
The blog has a main page that has cards representing blog posts. Each blog post has an article, about the author, links, related post links and share buttons.
